<p>For this project I will be creating a web page based off my html coding! I hope that you enjoy the step by step tutorial on how to create a webpage!</p>
<p> Step one you have to know the basic codes, to start off your document. For example, !doctype you would put that into "<>" Which would make it a code. Basic codes would be head, title, body, and html. Step two, your are going to need to know how to pace them correctly in the document. For example You wouldn't just place radom codes all over you document that would mess up your entire webpage. There is a specific order, !doctype, html, head, title, body. Step three you need to know what your are basing your webpage off, and what is the differences between a website and a webpage.</p>
<p> A webpage is just one page of a website. A website is multiple pages that have links that deliver you to other pages.</p>
<p> Step Four Code everything into a html document then you copy and paste it into a Microsoft Word document. Step Five you save it and once you reopen it, it SHOULD open into a web page, but I'm not sure because I am still experimenting with coding, and creating websites and pages</p>
<p>Once you transfer it into a html document it will turn into this</p>
